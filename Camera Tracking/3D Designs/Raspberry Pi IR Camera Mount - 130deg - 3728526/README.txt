Raspberry Pi IR Camera Mount - 130deg by Douglas_K on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3728526

Summary:
This is borne of my not wanting to have a light on in the room when I'm printing.  So, I'm running an infrared camera with it's own lighting.  This is the one I used:Raspberry Pi 3 Night Vision Fisheye Camera 5MP OV5647 130 Degree Focal Adjustable Camera for Raspberry Pi 3 Model B Plushttps://www.aliexpress.com/item/32932807062.htmlThe main design I based this on, "Raspberry Pi IR Camera Mount" by MonkeyBear", had the correct openings for the lights, but they were too far apart.  A bit of a remix fixed that.  Then I used a bit from the "T-slot V-slot Universal camera mount :CR10, tevo tornado, ender 3 logitech c270 c920, picamera, gopro, action camera , prusa mk3, others" to add the mounting bit that's compatible with the bed mount I use with my Ender 3 Pro, "Ender 3 bed camera mount logitech c270,pi camera,gopro,action camera, holder(BETA TESTING finished)"It works a treat, as the 2nd image shows.:)This mount connects with this mount system which works well with the Creality Ender 3: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2999957
